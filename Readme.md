#URAN

##Motivation
When I was using Z3 SMT solver (for the first time) to solve some challenging problems (many years ago), I often found myself spending most of the time to program all kinds of formuals which significantly slow down my development.  So I decide to build my own set of classes that can help me quickly construct the formuals I want and interact with solvers. In short, uran is an engine that you could place in between solvers and your own specification language, and totally seperate your code from the language that you design and underlying solvers.  

##Supported features
**Propositional Formula in CNF** Outputs dimacs format which can be accepted by SAT solvers.
**Quantified Boolean Formula** Conforms to the SMT2 Standard.
**Arithmetic Formula** Conforms to the SMT2 Standard.
**Increment SMT Solving** (push and pop).
**Iterative SMT Solving** (For your optimisation problems).
**SMT2 File Output**

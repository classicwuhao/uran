#URAN

##Motivation
When I was using [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) SMT solver (for the first time) to solve some challenging problems (many years ago), I often found myself spending most of the time to program all kinds of formuals which significantly slow down my development.  So I decide to build my own set of classes that can help me quickly construct the formuals I want and interact with solvers. In short, uran is an engine that you could place in between solvers and your own specification language, and totally seperate your code from the language that you design and underlying solvers.

##Supported features
*Boolean Circuit Gate.
*Quantified Boolean Formula.
*Arithmetic Formula.
*Increment SMT Solving.
*Iterative SMT Solving. 

##Output Format
*dimacs (SAT Solvers)
*[SMT2](http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/language.shtml) (SMT Solvers)

##Under Development
*Bit Vector Formula.
*Compact Sized Formula Generation.

##Supported SMT Solvers:
*[Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
*[CVC4](https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4)  - working in progress.
